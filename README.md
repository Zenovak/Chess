# Chess
UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

Using reference: https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-notation



# Design patterns used:
This chess game app will be based on typical MVC design, separating the game logics and the UI. 



# Game Mechanics design:
The data structure for the chess board will be a simple 1 dimension array size: 64.
I avoided using 2D array as it could get complicated to implement the legal moves validation algorithmn. 



# Future Plans.
Mobile release with MAUI.
Web Application release. 
Plug In for chess AI.
